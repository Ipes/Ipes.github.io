The following chart shows the number of active clinical trials with mesenchymal stem cells as reported at different times in literature.
While the number of early phase trials is increasing significantly, the evolution towards later phase trials, where production volumes are required to increase, is limited.
This can be at least partly attributed to the challenges regarding clinical-scale cell production.
