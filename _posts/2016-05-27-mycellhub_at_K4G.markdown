Yesterday (26 May 2016) [FlandersBio][fl_bio] hosted at [Knowledge for Growth] [kfg] in Ghent an exciting series of talks for the life sciences industry. More than 1200 participants and 450 companies were present for a full day of lectures, idea sharing and workshops.

The MyCellHub project was invited as one of the two innovation cases for an “Innovation Lab” workshop on co-creative approaches for multi-stakeholder collaboration in life sciences innovation, organized by [CMAST] [cmast]. The aim of the workshop was to illustrate CMAST’s toolkit for the identification of opportunities and gaps in an innovation project.
After a 30 minute brainstorm, the MyCellHub project was critically assessed by a very diverse group of people, yielding interesting feedback, a set of “next steps” and a unreserved reality check.

We’re already looking forward to part 2 of the workshop organized by [CMAST] [cmast] and [RegMed] [regmed] that will take place in two weeks (July 10th) at the Leuven Provincial House. This workshop will focus on translating innovation projects into concrete collaborations and the identification of local and European grant opportunities.
You can still register for this free workshop [here][register_cmast].
