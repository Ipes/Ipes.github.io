Last Friday (10 June 2016) [CMAST] [cmast] organised the second part of its Innovation Lab workshop. This workshop was a follow-up of the session on "Multi-stakeholder collaboration in life sciences innovation" at [Knowledge for Growth] [kfg] in Ghent as discussed in the previous post.
This second workshop in the Leuven Provincial House was organised in collaboration with [RegMed] [regmed] and focused on grant feasibility and collaboration.

In parallel with a session on the available funding sources for Regenerative Medicine projects and a session on open innovation and the link to public-private partnerships the MyCellHub project was again scrutinised in three 25 minute sessions.
Since many of the participants were linked to the [RegMed] [regmed] platform and knowledgeable about the challenges in cell-based bioprocesses, this brainstorm session again resulted in an insightful reality check for the project.
An overview of the outcome of the Innovation Lab session on the MyCellHub project can be found in the figure below. 

Clearly enough food for thought for the optimisation of the project!
