MyCellHub.com is an online platform that aims to use data-driven methods for the collaborative development and optimisation of cell-based bioprocesses.

As cell-based technologies are rapidly evolving, the demand for industrial scale production of cells is increasing.
However, the scale-up of cell production from the laboratory to a cost-effective and reliable industrial scale production process is not straightforward and requires large amounts of process data in order to prove process comparability.
The aim of MyCellHub.com is to facilitate this transition by providing more profound insight in cell-based bioprocesses.

We're currently shaping the platform so if you have ideas or suggestions, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}"> get in contact</a>!
