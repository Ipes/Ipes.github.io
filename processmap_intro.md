This page is used to render the interactive visualisations described in "Title" (soon to be) published in Tissue Engineering Part B. (make this a link)
For the process map that compares the different culture vessels, cell density at harvest, the process scale and expansion factor follow this link: [process map 1][pm1].
 
 
For the process map that compares the different cell types, resulting population doubling times, the process scale and expansion factor follow this link: [process map 2][pm2].
