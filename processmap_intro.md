This page is used to render the interactive visualisations described in "Large-scale mesenchymal stromal cell expansion: a visual tool for bioprocess efficiency comparability" (soon to be) published in [Tissue Engineering Part B][TEpartB]. 

For the process map that compares the different culture vessels, cell density at harvest, the process scale and expansion factor follow this link: [process map 1][pm1].
 
 
For the process map that compares the different cell types, resulting population doubling times, the process scale and expansion factor follow this link: [process map 2][pm2].
